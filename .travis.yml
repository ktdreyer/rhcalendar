    # * Travis CI's virtualenv already comes with pytest preinstalled.
    # * pytest-flake8 requires pytest>=2.8, and sometimes this requirement is
    #   higher than what Travis CI has pre-installed into the virtualenv.
    # * 'python setup.py test' uses EasyInstall, so it will not upgrade a
    #   package to a newer version if the package is already present in a
    #   virtualenv.
